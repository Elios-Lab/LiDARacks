# LiDARacks
Python toolkit to generate physically-grounded LiDAR anomalies for robust sensor testing: Background noise (simulating adverse weather conditions), Zero-Range Background (modeling sensor obstruction), Electromagnetic Interference (representing electronic noise), and Occlusion (ray diffusion/absorption).
